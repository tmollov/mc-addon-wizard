A **Behavior Pack** defines _logic_ — it tells Minecraft _how things act_, not _how they look_.  
It includes:

- Entities (AI, components, events)
- Items (their behaviors, stack size, food values, etc.)
- Blocks (interactions, hardness, tick behavior)
- Loot tables, recipes, functions, scripts, etc.

Some things that behavior pack *MUST* have:

- manifest.json                 # REQUIRED: Pack info (UUIDs, version, type= "data")
- pack_icon.png                # Optional but custom one recommended
